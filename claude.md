This is my personal branding. It’s my developer branding system that I will utilize it in my project when it’s ready, the branding system should include the components and the brand guidelines. I want to achieve a professional really jaw dropping and innovative aesthetic by combining [apple.inc](https://apple.inc) minimalistic and especially the new Liquid Glass design language introduced in the WWDC 2025 with my personality as a cli based, terminal lover, power user, keyboard centric hacker aesthetics, o I want a polished, fluid, effect rich and innovative terminal/apple aesthetics design system. The project should feature a components library for reusing in other projects, and rich documentation and brand guidelines, also should feature a strong magnetic brand identity for evoking curiosity interest in clients and other developers, it should be jaw dropping. Also don’t forget to use the @context7 @reftools and @21stmagic mcps for research and more actual documentation
