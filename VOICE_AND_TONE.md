_Clear, authoritative, helpful_

**Do:**

- "This component handles form validation with built-in error states and accessibility features."
- "Pro tip: Use the `liquid` variant for interactive elements that need tactile feedback."

**Don't:**

- "Revolutionary breakthrough in design"
- "Never before seen technology"
- "The only design system you'll ever need"

### 🐛 **Error Messages: Helpful Debugging Partner**

_Clear, non-judgmental, solution-focused_

**Do:**

- "Component prop 'variant' expected 'glass' | 'terminal', received 'magic'"
- "Missing required dependency: @threlte/core (WebGL components need their vitamins)"

**Don't:**

- "Invalid input"

## Language Principles

### ✅ **Use Technical Precision**

```md
✓ "Implements CSS backdrop-filter with fallback support"
✗ "Makes things look glassy and cool"

✓ "Optimized for tree-shaking with ESM exports"
✗ "Super optimized and lightweight"

✓ "Svelte 5 reactive primitives with TypeScript inference"
✗ "Latest and greatest Svelte features"
```

### ✅ **Acknowledge Developer Reality**

```md
✓ "Works great until your PM changes the requirements"
✓ "Supports IE11 (because enterprise clients still exist)"
✓ "Handles edge cases you didn't know you had"
✓ "Built by developers, for developers, with developer problems in mind"
```

### ✅ **Be Specific, Not Superlative**

```md
✓ "Reduces bundle size by 40% through selective imports"
✗ "Incredibly small bundle size"

✓ "23 tested components with accessibility compliance"
✗ "Tons of amazing components"

✓ "Sub-100ms interaction responses with hardware acceleration"
✗ "Lightning-fast performance"
```

### ✅ **Reference Developer Culture**

```md
✓ "No more CSS-in-JS existential crises"

```

## Vocabulary Guide

### **Preferred Terms**

- **Components** (not widgets, elements, or modules)
- **Design system** (not UI kit or component library)
- **Implementation** (not integration or usage)
- **Developer experience** (not user experience, when talking to developers)
- **Accessibility** (not a11y, in formal docs)
- **Performance** (not speed)
- **Terminal aesthetics** (not console styling)
- **Liquid glass** (not glassmorphism, in our context)

### **Technical Language Level**

```md
✓ "Implements render props pattern with TypeScript generics"
✓ "Uses CSS custom properties for theme interpolation"
✓ "Leverages Svelte's compile-time optimizations"
✓ "Provides tree-shakeable exports with proper ESM structure"
```

### **Avoid Marketing Speak**

```md
✗ "Game-changing", "Revolutionary", "Cutting-edge"
✗ "Best-in-class", "Industry-leading", "Next-generation"
✗ "Seamless", "Effortless", "Zero-configuration"
✗ "Enterprise-grade", "Production-ready", "Battle-tested"
```

## Emotional Tone Map

### **Confidence Level: High**

We know what we're building and why it matters.

### **Formality Level: Professional Casual**

We're serious about quality, relaxed about ego.

### **Technical Depth: Variable**

Match the audience's level without talking down.

### **Humor Style: Insider**

References that developers get, delivered with timing.

## Content Examples

### **Feature Announcement**

> "New in v2.1: RetroText component brings authentic bitmap font rendering to your terminal UIs. Six vintage variants including Commodore 64 and Apple II aesthetics, with proper accessibility support because even retro computing should be inclusive. Ships with TypeScript definitions and zero runtime dependencies, because we know you care about bundle size."

### **Getting Started Guide**

> "Let's build something that doesn't look like every other Bootstrap clone. A Hacker's Brand combines liquid glass aesthetics with terminal precision – think Apple's design language meets your favorite terminal emulator. Installation takes 30 seconds, customization takes a lifetime (in a good way)."

### **API Documentation**

> "The `variant` prop controls visual styling. 'glass' creates the signature liquid morphism effect, 'terminal' gives you that authentic command-line feel, and 'minimal' keeps things clean when your designer is watching. Each variant maintains consistent interaction patterns while adapting to your app's aesthetic needs."

### **Error Documentation**

> "Getting a TypeScript error about missing props? The component expects explicit type definitions for theme customization. Check the Props interface – TypeScript is being helpful, not hostile. Our type definitions catch configuration issues at compile time, saving you debugging time in production."

## Voice Checklist

Before publishing any content, ask:

- [ ] **Does this sound like a knowledgeable developer talking to peers?**
- [ ] **Are we being specific rather than superlative?**
- [ ] **Do we acknowledge real development challenges?**
- [ ] **Is the technical depth appropriate for the audience?**
- [ ] **Are we helpful without being condescending?**
- [ ] **Does this reflect our authentic passion for craft?**
- [ ] **Would a developer trust this voice with their production code?**

## Writing Examples by Persona

### **For Senior Developers**

> "Built with performance and maintainability as first-class concerns. Every component includes comprehensive TypeScript definitions, follows semantic versioning strictly, and ships with detailed migration guides. The motion system uses RAF-based animations with proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks in long-running applications."

### **For Design System Teams**

> "Designed for scale and consistency across teams. Token-based theming prevents design drift, component APIs stay stable across updates, and documentation generates automatically from TypeScript definitions. Includes design tokens export for Figma integration and comprehensive usage analytics."

### **For New Developers**

> "Each component includes working examples you can copy and paste. Hover over any prop in your IDE to see inline documentation. The TypeScript definitions will guide you to correct usage – think of them as friendly guardrails, not barriers. When something breaks, the error messages tell you exactly what to fix."
